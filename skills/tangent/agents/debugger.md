# Tangent: Debugger Agent

Diagnose a failed pipeline run. Find the root cause, write a failure snapshot,
return a one-line diagnosis.

## Tools

**Always use the published `tangle` CLI via Bash.** Install persistently with
`uv tool install tangle-cli`, or run one-off commands with
`uvx --from tangle-cli tangle …`. Examples below use bare `tangle …`; if
intentionally validating a local `tangle-cli` checkout, prefix examples with
`uv run` (see `OSS-CONVENTIONS.md` §1).

Run `tangle quickstart` to discover available commands. Use `--help` on any
command (or group, e.g. `tangle sdk pipeline-runs --help`) for detailed usage.
There is no `--help-extended` / `--help-full` and no `docs` command — for
debugging guidance, lean on `--help`, `tangle sdk published-components library`,
and the public OSS docs at
[github.com/TangleML/website/tree/master/docs](https://github.com/TangleML/website/tree/master/docs).

| What you need | Command |
|---|---|
| Run state & derived status summary | `tangle sdk pipeline-runs status RUN_ID` |
| Execution tree & task states | `tangle sdk pipeline-runs details RUN_ID --include-execution-state` |
| Graph execution state (per execution) | `tangle sdk pipeline-runs graph-state EXECUTION_ID` |
| Container logs (application stack traces, code errors) | `tangle sdk pipeline-runs logs EXECUTION_ID` |
| System events (eviction reasons, OOM kills, scheduling failures) | Launcher-native — NOT a Tangle command (see §7 and "Fetching System Events" below) |
| Search for runs | `tangle sdk pipeline-runs search --name <name>` |
| Component spec (per-task) | `tangle sdk pipeline-runs details RUN_ID --execution-id EXEC_ID --include-implementations` |
| Artifact metadata (URIs, size, hash) | `tangle sdk artifacts get RUN_ID -q '{"tasks": {...}}'` |
| Export pipeline spec | `tangle sdk pipeline-runs export RUN_ID --output output.yaml` |

Artifact retrieval is **metadata-only** (`artifacts get` returns `{id, uri, size,
hash}`); the `uri` is backend-agnostic — read the scheme, don't assume one. There
is no `artifacts download`. To fetch artifact bytes, follow the signed-URL recipe
in `OSS-CONVENTIONS.md` §5.

## Debugging Workflow

1. **Get failure details**: `tangle sdk pipeline-runs status RUN_ID` for a quick
   run + derived status summary, then `tangle sdk pipeline-runs details RUN_ID
   --include-execution-state` — shows the execution tree with per-task status. Get
   execution IDs for failed tasks. For a single failed execution's graph state,
   `tangle sdk pipeline-runs graph-state EXECUTION_ID`.
2. **Inspect the failed task**: `tangle sdk pipeline-runs details RUN_ID
   --execution-id EXEC_ID --include-implementations` — drill into the specific
   failed execution to see the component spec as actually used.
3. **Fetch logs and system events** (see "Fetching Container Logs" in
   `references/tangle-tools.md`): `tangle sdk pipeline-runs logs EXECUTION_ID`
   for application logs (stack traces, code errors). Container logs are keyed by
   **EXECUTION_ID**, not run id. For system events (eviction, OOM, scheduling,
   `pods "task-…" not found` mysteries), the Tangle backend does **not** store
   these — they are **launcher-specific**. Consult your launcher's runtime (see
   "Fetching System Events" below).
4. **Check for auth errors**: If logs show permission denied, 401/403, or token /
   credential errors, classify as `PERMISSION` and note in the resolution that the
   auth wizard (`agents/auth-wizard.md`) should be used to diagnose and fix the
   base-url / token / header credential setup.
5. **Check upstream artifacts**: If logs mention missing data/inputs, check upstream
   task outputs via `tangle sdk artifacts get RUN_ID -q '{"tasks": {...}}'` — an
   upstream task may have produced empty or wrong output. The result is
   metadata-only; existence/size/hash is often enough to spot an empty or truncated
   artifact. Only fetch bytes (signed-URL recipe, `OSS-CONVENTIONS.md` §5) when you
   genuinely need to inspect content.
6. **Export the pipeline**: `tangle sdk pipeline-runs export RUN_ID --output
   /tmp/pipeline.yaml` to get the exact pipeline spec used. Adjacent run arguments
   were supplied at submit time via `--arg K=V` / `--args-json` / `--config` (there
   is no `-f config.yaml`).
7. **Fix and re-run** (see Submission Rules in `references/tangle-tools.md`):
   Modify the exported YAML, then resubmit. Hydration is the default; there is no
   `--dehydrate` step to run first and no `--no-wait` flag (submit never waits):
   ```bash
   tangle sdk pipeline-runs submit /tmp/pipeline.yaml \
     --arg <key>=<value>
   ```
   Submit returns immediately; to block on the result, use
   `tangle sdk pipeline-runs wait RUN_ID --max-wait N`. After submission, you may
   annotate the run with generic provenance:
   ```bash
   tangle sdk pipeline-runs annotations set <RUN_ID> source tangle-cli
   ```

## Fetching System Events

The Tangle backend stores **container logs** (via `pipeline-runs logs
EXECUTION_ID`) but **not** Kubernetes/system events. For OOM kills, evictions,
scheduling failures, and "pod not found" mysteries, consult your launcher's own
runtime:

| Launcher | System-event source |
|---|---|
| `kubernetes`, `google_kubernetes` | `kubectl get events`, `kubectl describe pod <pod>` |
| `local_docker` | `docker logs <container>`, `docker inspect <container>` |
| `skypilot` | the cluster console / `sky logs` |
| `huggingface` | the Space's logs in the HF UI |

**INFRA-failure graceful degradation.** Because there is no unified system-event
search, INFRA diagnosis is a weaker signal in OSS than in environments with a
central observability backend. When the container logs alone don't explain a
failure (e.g. the process is killed with no stack trace, or a task vanishes), lean
on container logs first, then the launcher-native events above. If neither yields a
root cause, classify as `INFRA` with the symptom you observed and recommend
re-running and checking the launcher runtime — do not block on a system-event
search the OSS surface cannot perform.

## Inputs

- `run_id` — the failed run
- `failure_playbook` — scenario's failure playbook (YAML)
- `task_mapping` — task name → source file
- `snapshot_path` — where to write the snapshot

## Output

1. **Snapshot file** at `<snapshot_path>`:
```markdown
# Failure: <run_id>
- **Execution ID**: <exec_id>
- **Failed Task**: <task_name>
- **Failure Type**: <PERMISSION|INFRA|CONFIG|TRAINING|EVAL|UNKNOWN>
- **Timestamp**: <iso8601>

## Error
<root cause>

## Container Logs (last 50 lines)
<logs>

## Resolution
- **Action**: <retry|record|fix|investigate>

## Lesson Learned
<one-line takeaway>
```

2. **Return message**: `<FAILURE_TYPE>: <description> → <action>`
